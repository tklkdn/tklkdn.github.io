	  <h1>University of Colorado at Boulder<br>2008-2012</h1>
	  <p>At CU Boulder I majored in English and Psychology. Here, I was geared to think critically and practice research inquiry with rigor.</p>

	  <h1>Goodwill Industries of Denver<br>2013-2015</h1>
	  <p>In the few years that followed graduation, I discovered that these skills can be exercised to tackle problems and find solutions in the workplace. But for me they were far too underutilized.</p>

	  <h1>Jefferson County Public Library<br>2015-2016</h1>
	  <p>Around this time I found a potential niche for me to fit into. It was in the UX field, where I could see myself fulfilling a role that matched my interests and abilities.</p>

	  <h1>Red Rocks Community College<br>2015-2016</h1>
	  <p>I took classes on Python and SQL, as well as front-end development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) on my own time. Even if programming knowledge is not required to be a practitioner of UX, I had the hunch that learning even a little coding would be immensely helpful.</p>

	  <h1>University of Texas at Austin<br>2016-2018</h1>
	  <p>I immersed myself in a program offered at the School of Information. Leveraging my background as an English major and a Psychology major, and harnessing what I was able to learn from taking programming courses, I learned about user experience research and design methods and had the opportunity to practice them, sometimes with real clients. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I was involved in during my time here.</p>

	  <h1>Tokyo Electron<br>2016-Present</h1>
	  <p>I was hired to work as a Business Systems Analyst Intern. I built intranet sites, business forms, and automated workflows, but most importantly, this internship afforded me the chance and experience to work with actual stakeholders. They needed business-side solutions to business-side problems, and I was the one in charge to deliver the former.
