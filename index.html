      <h1>Taka Kodani</h1>
      <p>Some years ago I accidentally did UX at work without knowing what UX was and now here I am  doing UX purposefully. But that's not all–I also do some UI design, coding, and business automation.</p>

      <h1>Tokyo Electron</h1>
      <p>Working as a Business Systems Analyst since December of 2016, I have provided SharePoint support, developed automated workflows, forms, and intranet sites, and managed the (re)build of complex business systems. Here are some of my projects.</p>

      <h1>Traffic</h1>
	  <p>Applications like Google Maps and Waze have improved our facility to navigate traffic and be forewarned of any unexpected congestions. And the question came to us, can we somehow use this data to quantify traffic and then use the quantified information to identify traffic patterns? And can we apply these patterns to our own commuter lives?</p>

      <h1>Brownie</h1>
	  <p>Brownie is a concept for a smart home application for senior citizens. By surrounding them with an integrated system that monitors many of their household, health, and security needs, senior citizens who live on their own can be assured of greater independence in their own homes, thereby reducing their need for caretaker support.</p>

      <h1>StoryUs</h1>
	  <p>StoryUs is a concept for families to share multimedia stories to other family members. Combining aspects of geneology, social media, and storytelling into one platform, the mobile app we designed allows users to tell their stories to, and listen to stories from, current family members, as well as to pass them down for generations to come.</p>

      <h1>The Refuge</h1>
	  <p>A nonprofit organization depends on donations. And a website serves as its digital face–the more satisfying the experience, the more it can generate donations. With this in mind, I conducted a heuristic analysis and usability test for the Refuge to gauge UX metrics.</p>
