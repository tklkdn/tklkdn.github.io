			<h1>TRAFFIC</h1>
			<h3 style="text-align: right;">Measuring Traffic with Google Apps API</h3>
			<p>Poor commute is a common experience in large cities. As drivers we want to understand the general flow of traffic, but traffic sensor data is inaccessible to the public. Is there a simple way to analyze and discover traffic patterns by ourselves?</p>
			<div>
				<img data-src="img/gmap.png" class="lazy image" style="border-radius: 50%;"></img>
			</div>
			<h3>Idea #1: Google Maps</h3>
			<p>Step 1: Open map of Austin in browser<br><br>Step 2: Take a screenshot at set intervals using auto screenshot capture + auto refresh applications<br><br>Step 3: Count the number of green, orange, red, and maroon pixels using Python script<br><br>Step 4: Generate traffic scores</p>
			<p>But...</p>
			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<p>We cannot use PC while running setup. It is inefficient to save images and process them one by one. Inconsistencies become a common theme from trying to sync up all applications, and manual setup sometimes leads to human error.</p>
			<h3>Idea #2: Google Maps Distance Matrix API</h3>
			<p>We can automatically collect travel time from various routes. Setup is easy: Set timer, start script, let it run in the background, and data is written in csv file (instead of as large png files). We can then convert times into traffic severity scores and aggregate scores.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>

			</div>
			<h3>Austin Traffic Score App</h3>
			<p>We have created a simple web app to display general traffic patterns in Austin, divided by main regions. It uses Google Maps API + collected historical data to "predict" future traffic severity of a region.</p>
			<div>
				<img data-src="img/app.gif" class="lazy image"></img>
			</div>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Data needs to be validated with actual sensor data.<br><br>Route selection and region mapping bias.<br><br>Only two weeks' worth of data collected.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>There is potential for method to be used in future traffic studies. Google Maps API is inexpensive, accessible, and scalable. The information is also useful on personal level, informing user on traffic patterns within own commute</p>

      <h1>BROWNIE</h1>
			<h3 style="text-align: right;">Automation for the Elderly</h3>
			<p style="display: none;">Brownie is a concept for a smart home application for senior citizens. By surrounding them with an integrated system that monitors many of their household, health, and security needs, senior citizens who live on their own can be assured of greater independence in their own homes, thereby reducing their need for caretaker support.</p>
			<p>Senior citizens are projected to increasingly live on their own, thereby requiring the help of their children or caretakers, the latter of which may:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Be expensive to hire</li>
		    <li>Be difficult to find</li>
		    <li>Deprive the elderly of a sense of independence</li>
		  </ul>
			<h3>Idea</h3>
			<p>A comprehensive smart home system catered for the elderly.</p>
			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>Such a system would need to tackle the following challenges posed by the target audience, to name a few:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Limited mobility 
				<li>Physical disabilities or impairment
				<li>Discomfort with technology
				<li>Emergencies such as falling accidents
			</ul>
			<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
			<p>We cross-examined related companies and products:<br><br>HoneyCo | Samsung SmartThings | Crestron | Lively Activity Sensors<br><br>Our purpose was to identify their strengths and weaknesses and find areas for opportunity. HoneyCo came the closest to paralleling what we trying to accomplish but lacked user-friendliness and comprehensiveness.</p>
			<h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
			<p>To design a smart home system that best served the needs of the older population, we had to understand the following:
		  <ul>
		    <li>How they lived their daily lives and what difficulties they faced</li>
		    <li>Their health conditions and problems</li>
		    <li>Their interactions with and attitude toward high-tech devices</li>
		    <li>How their adult children played a role</li>
		  </ul>
			<h3>Interviews</h3>
			<p>Three older adults between the ages of 61 and 70, as well as three younger adults between the ages of 43 and 46, were interviewed. Seniors were generally less comfortable with technology, but privacy was considered very important by all. Additionally, health was seen as major concern. For the most part there was frequent communication between parents and children.</p>
			<h3>Survey</h3>
			<p>We conducted an online survey for adults 35 and up. Respondents who were 55+ reported lower trust level for automation and lower comfort with technology. Most respondents valued privacy, security, safety, health monitoring.</p>
			<h3>Opportunity</h3>
			<p>Demand for automation services was low among elderly but could be ascribed to unfamiliarity with technology in general. Our aim was to to be able to <b>bridge</b> this gap by creating a user-friendly and useful solution for seniors.</p>
			<h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
			<img data-src="img/affinity.jpg" class="lazy image"/>
			<p>Main points from interviews and surveys were collated, then sorted into categories: Automation, Reminder, Health, Contact, and Other</p>
			<h3>Personas</h3>
		  <p>We created personas, who embodied the voice of our interview and survey participants, to help guide our design process</p>
			<div class="center">

				</div>
			</div>
			<h3 style="clear: both;">Ideation</h3>
			<p>Using the ideas and concepts we gathered up to this point, we began to visualize them in the form of a mobile app.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Single interface: All user interaction would begin and end at the app</li>
				<li>Maximizing ease of use for seniors where manual interactions are needed</li>
				<li>Automating everything else</li>
			</ul>

			</div>
			<h3 style="clear: both;">Low fidelity prototype</h3>
	    <img data-src="img/lo-fi.png" class="lazy image"/>
			<p>All of our prototypes were built with Sketch and InVision. The architecture of the app was based on categories from affinity diagram. Each category serves a specific function, including automating the home, monitoring health status, scheduling reminders, and allowing direct contact with family or emergency services</p>
			<h3>User testing 1</h3>
			<p>We conducted face-to-face usability tests with eight participants. We wrote a script consisting of five basic tasks. Unfortunately, lack of resources led to the recruitment of young participants for the first test round (all under 30). We were nonetheless able to gather plenty of useful feedback on the app.</p>
			<h3>Modification 1</h3>
			<p>Contact function was relegated in favor of a Help section due to it being redundant with a smartphone's native features and with social media apps. Wording was changed to enhance clarity. We narrowed the scope of the reminder system to medications and reduced number of navigatable screens. We also introduced color coding to distinguish normal from abnormal health status.</p>
			<h3>High fidelity prototype</h3>
			<img data-src="img/hi-fi-1.png" class="lazy"/>
			<h3>User testing 2</h3>
			<p>Usability tests were conducted with twelve remote participants from UserTesting.com. Unlike the first round of testing, participants were closer to our target user group, between the ages of 55 and 70.</p>
			<img data-src="img/usertesting.PNG" class="lazy"/>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Participants rated each task and the app overall.</p>

			<p><b>Overall difficulty</b>, avg score (1-5, 5 very easy): <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:3.5vh;">4.82</span><br><b>Overall satisfaction</b>, avg score (1-5, 5 very satisfied): <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:3.5vh;">4.91</span></p>
			<h3>Modification 2</h3>
			<p>Feedback was very positive: Participants liked the simplicity and intuitiveness of an app that handles various household functions and monitoring. This aligned with our goal to keep the system simple for those less comfortable with technology, but there were a few small suggestions for change that we implemented:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Icon readability was improved, particularly on the health screen</li>
				<li>Vocabulary was modified for better comprehension</li>
			</ul>
			<img data-src="img/hi-fi-app.PNG" class="lazy"/>
			<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
			<p><b>Thinking from the perspectives of senior citizens</b> meant designing an interface a little differently from how we otherwise might have designed it. For example, it was important to use bigger icons and bigger fonts than usual, to avoid the use of "hidden" screens, and to employ high contrasts to enable better readability.</p>
