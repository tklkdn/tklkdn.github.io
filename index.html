      <h1>TOKYO ELECTRON</h1>
			<h3 style="text-align: right;">Business Systems Analyst</h3>
			<div class="card">
				<h3 class="blue-text">Responsibilities</h3>
				<p>Working as a Business Systems Analyst since December of 2016, I have provided SharePoint support, training, and documentation; conducted interviews and offered solutions for business problems; built and maintained automated workflows and forms to support business processes; and developed and enhanced content, structure, architecture, and design for intranet sites.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h3 class="blue-text">Quote Generation & Approval System Design</h3>
				<p>This is one project I worked on, in conjunction with my Master's program capstone. The description of the project that follows serves as one example among the many other similar projects I have undertaken during my time here at Tokyo Electron and, hopefully, illustrates my role as an intermediary between the people and the technology for better facilitating the former's business needs.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Introduction</h3>
				<p>Tokyo Electron is a company that manufactures semiconductor equipment. It has a major customer who request quotes on a regular basis, whether it is to procure new tools to modify any already-owned tools. The process of generating these quotes is specific to this customer and goes through a complicated set of procedures.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">The Problem</h3>
				<p>Once a quote request is placed it goes through a system in which the quote is created and then passed through several approval stages via automated notifications and approval tracking. Hosted on SharePoint, the system was built with InfoPath and SharePoint Designer. But Microsoft is dropping support for InfoPath in several years.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Another Problem</h3>
				<p>This system is used exclusively by one business unit (BU 1). But another business unit (BU 2) has requested setting up its own automated system, similar to the one BU 1 is using. Currently, the quote requests BU 2 receives from the customer are created and approved manually, which makes tracking multiple quotes difficult.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Goals</h3>
				<p>To produce a business solution that 1) allows BU 1 to continue generating quotes and gather approvals in an automated manner using new mathods and developer tools and 2) provides BU 2 with an automated system of its own. The new system should be <b>funtional</b>, <b>user-friendly</b>, and <b>maintainable</b>.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Interviewing</h3>
				<p>Acting as the project manager and main developer, I gathered requirements from key stakeholders—individuals who create quotes as well as those who approve them. The system comprises of many parts—I needed to understand its various components and how they all worked together before proposing any solution.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Assessing</h3>
				<p>I analyzed the available developer tools that could replace InfoPath and SharePoint Designer and offered four different options on how to build the system. Each option had its pros and cons, and I made my recommendation to the team and stakeholders, who subsequently selected one option out of the four.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Developing</h3>
				<p>I began to develop the new system in a test environment using a combination of SharePoint Server, Microsoft Excel, and Nintex Workflow. The Excel files required macros, which in turn led me down the road of having to learn and implement basic VBA. Stakeholders provided feedback on a weekly basis through meetings, where I showed project progress by giving piecemeal demonstrations on what I had been able to build.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Testing</h3>
				<p>Functional testing and usability testing took place to confirm the new system worked the way it was meant to, and to ensure users did not have troubles using it. The new system continued to be refined over the course of the next several months, after launching in a production environment.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Results</h3>
				<p>I finished creating a quote generation and approval system for both BU 1 and BU 2. It operates as follows: The quote is created using an Excel file, the template of which is automatically generated via a Nintex workflow. A quote number is also auto-generated at the same time. After the quote is filled out and submitted for approval, a separate workflow reads the file and processes it for approval by sending it to the appropriate approvers in three sequential stages. After the quote receives all approvals it is published for customer review.</p>
				<h3 class="blue-text">Challenges</h3>
				<p>Rebuilding the system for BU 1 was relatively smooth but progress had been slower translating the manual quote process into an automated one for BU 2. Initial idea was to "copy" BU 1's new system for BU 2 but business processes and user history/expectations were different and had to be accounted for, in order to execute proper change management. System launch, training, and documentations were delayed but eventually completed.</p>

			<h1>TRAFFIC SCORING</h1>
			<h3 style="text-align: right;">Measuring Traffic with Google Apps API</h3>
			<div class="card">
				<h3 class="green-text">Problem statement</h3>
				<p>Poor commute is a common experience in large cities. As drivers we want to understand the general flow of traffic, but traffic sensor data is inaccessible to the public. Is there a simple way to quantify, analyze, and discover traffic patterns by ourselves?</p>
				<h3 class="green-text">Idea #1: Google Maps</h3>
				<p>Step 1: Open map of Austin in browser<br><br>Step 2: Take a screenshot at set intervals using auto screenshot capture + auto refresh applications<br><br>Step 3: Count the number of green, orange, red, and maroon pixels using Python script<br><br>Step 4: Generate traffic scores</p>
				<p>But...</p>
				<h3 class="green-text">Issues</h3>
				<p>We cannot use PC while running setup. It is inefficient to save images and process them one by one. Inconsistencies become a common theme from trying to sync up all applications, and manual setup sometimes leads to human error.</p>
				<h3 class="green-text">Idea #2: Google Maps Distance Matrix API</h3>
				<p>We can automatically collect travel time from various routes using the Distance Matrix API. After the script for it is written, setup is easy: Set timer, start script, let it run in the background, and data is written in csv file (instead of as large png files).<br><br> We collect data over a span of a few weeks, at which point we are then able to convert times into traffic severity scores and aggregate scores.</p>
				<h3 class="green-text">Results</h3>

					<img data-src="img/image2.png" class="lazy image"></img>
				</div>
				<div>
					<img data-src="img/image3.png" class="lazy image"></img>
				</div>
				<h3 class="green-text">Austin Traffic Score App</h3>
				<p>We have created a simple web app to display general traffic patterns in Austin, divided by main regions. It uses Google Maps API + collected historical data to "predict" future traffic severity of a region.</p>
				<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/tklkdn/austin-traffic" target="_blank" class="external">Austin Traffic</a></p>
				<img data-src="img/app.gif" class="lazy image"></img>
				<h3 class="green-text">Limitations</h3>
				<p>Data needs to be validated with actual sensor data.<br><br>Route selection and region mapping bias.<br><br>Only two weeks' worth of data collected.</p>
				<h3 class="green-text">Conclusion</h3>
				<p>There is potential for method to be used in future traffic studies. Google Maps API is inexpensive, accessible, and scalable. The information is also useful on personal level, informing user on traffic patterns within own commute</p>

			<h1>BROWNIE</h1>
			<h3 style="text-align: right; padding-top: 20px;">HOME AUTOMATION FOR THE ELDERLY</h3>
			<p style="display: none;">Brownie is a concept for a smart home application for senior citizens. By surrounding them with an integrated system that monitors many of their household, health, and security needs, senior citizens who live on their own can be assured of greater independence in their own homes, thereby reducing their need for caretaker support.</p>
			<div class="card">
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Problem statement</h3>
				<p>Senior citizens are projected to increasingly live on their own. They may require the support of their children or caretakers, the latter of which may:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&bull; Be expensive to hire</li>
					<li>&bull; Be difficult to find</li>
					<li>&bull; Deprive the elderly of a sense of independence</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Our idea</h3>
				<p>We conceived a comprehensive smart home system catered for the elderly.</p>

				<h3 class="brownie-text">Challenges</h3>
				<p>Such a system would need to tackle the following challenges posed by the target audience, to name a few:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&bull; Limited mobility 
					<li>&bull; Physical disabilities or impairment
					<li>&bull; Discomfort with technology
					<li>&bull; Emergencies such as falling accidents
				</ul>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Design process</h3>
				<img src="img/Brownie_Design_Process.png" class="lazy image"/>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Competitor Analysis</h3>
				<p>We cross-examined related companies and products:<br><br>HoneyCo | Samsung SmartThings | Crestron | Lively Activity Sensors<br><br>Our purpose was to identify their strengths and weaknesses and find areas for opportunity. HoneyCo came the closest to paralleling what we trying to accomplish but lacked user-friendliness and comprehensiveness.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Contextual Inquiry</h3>
				<p>To design a smart home system that best served the needs of the older population, we had to understand the following:
				<ul>
					<li>&bull; How they lived their daily lives and what difficulties they faced</li>
					<li>&bull; Their health conditions and problems</li>
					<li>&bull; Their interactions with and attitude toward high-tech devices</li>
					<li>&bull; How their adult children played a role</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Interviews</h3>
				<p>Three older adults between the ages of 61 and 70, as well as three younger adults between the ages of 43 and 46, were interviewed. Seniors were generally less comfortable with technology, but privacy was considered very important by all. Additionally, health was seen as major concern. For the most part there was frequent communication between parents and children.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Survey</h3>
				<p>We conducted an online survey for adults 35 and up. Respondents who were 55+ reported lower trust level for automation and lower comfort with technology. Most respondents valued privacy, security, safety, health monitoring.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Opportunity</h3>
				<p>Demand for automation services was low among elderly but could be ascribed to unfamiliarity with technology in general. Our aim was to to be able to <b>bridge</b> this gap by creating a user-friendly and useful solution for seniors.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Affinity Diagram</h3>
				<img data-src="img/affinity.jpg" class="lazy image"/><br>
				<p>Main points from interviews and surveys were collated, then sorted into categories: Automation, Reminder, Health, Contact, and Other.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Personas</h3>
				<p>We created personas, who embodied the voice of our interview and survey participants, to help guide our design process.</p>

				<p style="clear: both;">Credit: Yueying Zhou</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Ideation</h3>
				<p>Using the ideas and concepts we gathered up to this point, we began to visualize them in the form of a mobile app.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&bull; Single interface: All user interaction would begin and end at the app</li>
					<li>&bull; Maximizing ease of use for seniors where manual interactions are needed</li>
					<li>&bull; Automating everything else</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Sketches</h1>
				<div class="center">

				</div>
				<h3 class="brownie-text" style="clear: both;">Low fidelity prototype</h3>
				<img data-src="img/lo-fi.png" class="lazy image"/>
				<p>All of our prototypes were built with Sketch and InVision. The architecture of the app was based on categories from affinity diagram. Each category serves a specific function, including automating the home, monitoring health status, scheduling reminders, and allowing direct contact with family or emergency services.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">User testing 1</h3>
				<p>We conducted face-to-face usability tests with eight participants. We wrote a script consisting of five basic tasks. Unfortunately, lack of resources led to the recruitment of young participants for the first test round (all under 30). We were nonetheless able to gather plenty of useful feedback on the app.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Modification 1</h3>
				<p>Contact function was relegated in favor of a Help section due to it being redundant with a smartphone's native features and with social media apps. Wording was changed to enhance clarity. We narrowed the scope of the reminder system to medications and reduced number of navigatable screens. We also introduced color coding to distinguish normal from abnormal health status.</p>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">High fidelity prototype</h3>
				<img data-src="img/hi-fi-1.png" class="lazy image"/>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">User testing 2</h3>
				<p>Usability tests were conducted with twelve remote participants from UserTesting.com. Unlike the first round of testing, participants were closer to our target user group, between the ages of 55 and 70.</p>
				<img data-src="img/usertesting.PNG" class="lazy image"/>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Results</h3>
				<p>Participants rated each task and the app overall.</p>

				<h3 class="brownie-text">Modification 2</h3>
				<p>Feedback was very positive: Participants liked the simplicity and intuitiveness of an app that handles various household functions and monitoring. This aligned with our goal to keep the system simple for those less comfortable with technology, but there were a few small suggestions for change that we implemented:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&bull; Icon readability was improved, particularly on the health screen</li>
					<li>&bull; Vocabulary was modified for better comprehension</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">High fidelity prototype 2</h3>
				<img data-src="img/hi-fi-app.PNG" class="lazy image" style="width: 50%;"/>
				<h3 class="brownie-text">Lessons Learned</h3>
				<p><b>Thinking from the perspectives of senior citizens</b> meant designing an interface a little differently from how we otherwise might have designed it. For example, it was important to use bigger icons and bigger fonts than usual, to avoid the use of "hidden" screens, and to employ high contrasts to enable better readability.</p>

				<p>Stakeholders for the Refuge stated an overview of the organization's missions, activities, priorities, and current status. They already had a website but wished to improve it. Their main goals were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>&bull; To increase donations</li>
					<li>&bull; To increase traffic</li>
					<li>&bull; To increase awareness</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="brown-text">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
				<p>Overall design and layout are already decent. But what can be done to improve usability and fulfillment of organization's goals? I conducted an evaluation based on Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.</p>
